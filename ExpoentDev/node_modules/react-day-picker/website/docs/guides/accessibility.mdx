# Accessible Date Pickers

DayPicker follows the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/examples/datepicker-dialog/) for date pickers, including features like keyboard navigation, focus management, and labeling.

Depending on your design, you might need to add more accessibility features. For example, when using [Input Fields](../guides/input-fields), there may be some limitations based on your accessibility goals. Keep up with best practices by following the [ARIA Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/).

## Accessibility Tips

- Test your date picker regularly with a screen reader to ensure accessibility.
- Use an `aria-live` region to announce when a date is selected, utilizing the `footer` prop.
- Customize ARIA labels with the [`labels`](../api/interfaces/PropsBase.md#labels) prop for better user feedback.
- Ensure the date picker is fully navigable with just the keyboard.
- Provide clear focus indicators for keyboard users.
- Maintain sufficient color contrast between text and background.
- Offer instructions for first-time users or those unfamiliar with the date picker.

## Announcing the Selected Date {#footer}

Here is an example of an accessible date picker with a live region that announces the selected date using the `footer` prop.

```tsx title="./AccessibleDatePicker.tsx"
import { format } from "date-fns";
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";

export function AccessibleDatePicker() {
  const [meetingDate, setMeetingDate] = React.useState<Date | undefined>(
    undefined
  );

  const footer = meetingDate
    ? `Meeting date is set to ${format(meetingDate, "PPPP")}`
    : "Please pick a date for the meeting.";

  const labels = {
    labelCaption: () => "Select a date for the meeting",
    labelDay: (date, modifiers) => {
      return modifiers.selected
        ? `Selected Meeting Date: ${format(date, "PPP")}`
        : "";
    }
  };

  return (
    <DayPicker
      mode="single"
      onSelect={setMeetingDate}
      selected={meetingDate}
      labels={labels}
      footer={footer}
    />
  );
}
```

<BrowserWindow>
  <Examples.AccessibleDatePicker />
</BrowserWindow>

## Autofocusing the Calendar {#autofocus}

DayPicker manages focus automatically when users interact with the calendar. For better accessibility, you might want to autofocus the calendar when it opens. Use the `autoFocus` prop to achieve this:

```tsx
<DayPicker mode="single" autoFocus />
```

## Keyboard Navigation

DayPicker supports keyboard navigation to make it easier for users to navigate the calendar. The following keys are supported:

| Keys                         | Function                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| <kbd>Arrow Up</kbd>          | Move focus to the previous week.     |
| <kbd>Arrow Right</kbd>       | Move focus to the next day.          |
| <kbd>Arrow Down</kbd>        | Move focus to the next week.         |
| <kbd>Arrow Left</kbd>        | Move focus to the previous day.      |
| <kbd>Page Up</kbd>           | Move focus to the previous month.    |
| <kbd>Page Down</kbd>         | Move focus to the next month.        |
| <kbd>Shift + Page Up</kbd>   | Move focus to the previous year.     |
| <kbd>Shift + Page Down</kbd> | Move focus to the next year.         |
| <kbd>Home</kbd>              | Move focus to the start of the week. |
| <kbd>End</kbd>               | Move focus to the end of the week.   |
| <kbd>Enter/Space</kbd>       | Select the focused day.              |
