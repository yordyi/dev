in screenpipe we have a plugin system called "pipe store" or "pipes"

think of it like this:

screenpipe data -> your pipe like "AI annotate" or "send to salesforce"

a more dev-friendly explanation:

screenpipe | AI tag | notion update

or 

screenpipe | AI tag | slack send report

or 

screenpipe | fill salesforce

or 

screenpipe | logs daily

basically it would read, process, annotate, analyse, summarize, send, your data customisable to your desire, effortlessly

### pipe-focus-notification-buddy

this is an experimental, but official pipe

this is how you run it through the app:

`ollama run phi3.5`

then drop the url of this folder in the pipe store and it works 

works also with CLI
