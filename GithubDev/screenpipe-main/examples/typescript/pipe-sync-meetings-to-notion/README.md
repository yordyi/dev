in screenpipe we have a plugin system called "pipe store" or "pipes"

think of it like this:

screenpipe data -> your pipe like "AI annotate" or "send to salesforce"

a more dev-friendly explanation:

screenpipe | AI tag | notion update

or 

screenpipe | AI tag | slack send report

or 

screenpipe | fill salesforce

or 

screenpipe | logs daily

basically it would read, process, annotate, analyse, summarize, send, your data customisable to your desire, effortlessly

### pipe-sync-meetings-to-notion

this is an experimental, but official pipe, that will sync your meetings to notion
