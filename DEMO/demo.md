Founder, Prisma

After many recommendations, I finally switched from VSC to Cursor and ... wow!

It's absolutely incredible. If you like Copilot (or if you don't), you'll be blown away by Cursor. There is no going back. ðŸ¤¯

Cursor has changed the game. I really can't imagine writing code without it at this point. The switch from VSCode is easy, and now I have AI superpowers right in my editor and my terminal.

Cursor is awesome!

Someone finally put AI into a code editor in a seamless way. It's so elegant and easy. I'm an hour in and already hooked.

Engineering, Reflect

Cursor is the best product I've used in a while - it's an AI enabled editor.

I just asked it to write a README for a project I've been working on - analyzed the code-base and worked first time.

Director, Weights & Biases

Cursor is so good, and literally gets better/more feature-rich every couple of weeks.
